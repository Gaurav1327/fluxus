								<p>ELEGANCIA</p>
								<p>Be a Super Diva! Incoherent chatter prevailed as the audience waited for the curtains to unveil what was behind them. Everyone waited anxiously for the great masterpiece to be revealed. Amidst the hustle and bustle, the curtains slowly drew apart. And then there was silence. Everyone was starstruck by the angelic beauty that stood on stage. She exuded an ethereal aura, almost surreal, like a beam of sunlight cutting through the darkness. As she walked, the rhythmic click of her heels was the only sound that domineered. Her eyes shone brightly and as her lips curved into a radiant smile the spectators were spellbound. Her glossy hair flowed in sync with the melody that played behind, hypnotizing them.This is a competition tailor-made for all of you who ever aspired to be the next glamorous diva. If you think you have what it takes to mesmerize an audience with your presence and if beauty is your strong forte this competition is just for you. Come set the stage on fire with your charm and charisma at Fluxus’20.<br>Team Size: Solo<br>
